# cpm_data_analysis
The codes uploaded to this repository are used for analyzing the CPM data obtained through ASTROSAT. The code cpm_database.py is used to collect information from multiple mkf files and consolidate it into a single database. The codes noise_detect.py and cpm_peaks.py are used to detect noise and peaks of the CPM data respectively. The noise peaks are removed in noise_detect.py. The code med_plt.py is used to visualize the behaviour of peaks in the latitude-longitude plane and fit it subsequently. Finnaly, com_orb.py is used for genrating groups of Common Orbits for analysing the data on small resolutions. 

It is recommended that the codes are run in the order that they have ocurred in the paragraph above.
